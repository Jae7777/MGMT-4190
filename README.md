Welcome to my repository for the Machine Learning class I took at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). This repository contains all my labs, homework, and project files created during the course. The primary goal of this repository is to showcase my learning journey and highlight the key concepts and techniques I explored.

📂 Repository Contents

The repository is structured as follows:

```bash
├── labs/  # Lab assignments exploring foundational ML concepts
├── homeworks/  # Homework assignments with problem-solving tasks
├── projects/
│   └── TimeSeriesForecasting/  # Main project: Future sales prediction in Ecuador
└── README.md  # This file
```

🏆 Main Project: Time Series Forecasting

The highlight of this repository is the Time Series Forecasting Project, where I developed and trained a model to predict future sales in Ecuador. The project focuses on:

    Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis.
    Model Selection: Evaluating models like ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet to find the best fit for time series forecasting.
    Evaluation Metrics: Using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess model performance.
    Tools and Libraries: Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and more.

You can find the project's details in the Projects/TimeSeriesForecasting/ directory.
🔬 Labs and Homework

    The Labs directory includes Jupyter Notebooks covering hands-on experiments with concepts such as regression, classification, clustering, and neural networks.
    The Homework directory contains problem-solving tasks designed to deepen understanding of machine learning principles.

🔧 Tools and Technologies

    Languages: Python
    Libraries: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and others.
    Environment: Jupyter Notebook, Python 3.12
